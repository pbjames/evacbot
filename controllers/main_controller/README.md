# Evacbot Main Controller

This is the code which decides what the robot does. If you have any questions then bring
them up when we meet or message me on anything!.

## Usage

This should automatically be registered by Webots if this folder is chosen correctly as
the project directory. This means you don't have to do anything else.

## Plans

To reiterate our proposal:

- Tamryn does SLAM
- Xiaoyu does hazard detection
- James does pathing (w/ SLAM + hazards)

## Contribution

Just use well-named commits, and branch if you can. I'll try to lead by example.
