# Autonomous safety evaluation & rescue for subterranean confined spaces

## Get started

Clone this repo by running the following:

`git clone https://github.com/pbjames/evacbot`

or use the SSH link generated by GitHub if that's how you're authenticated.

Open webots and go to `File / Open World...` and select the world at
`evacbot/worlds/default.wbt`. Now webots should open this project by default when
started.

## Evaluation

### Considerations

It's difficult to simulate everything accurately so we will focus on accurate and
efficient approximations for the environment. Think of how we could potentially extend
and build on the principles of what we are testing in a serious, commercial environment.

In particular, I think we should focus on simulating many different kinds of environment
with different kinds of hazards and obstructions for the robot to navigate through. This
should help also facilitate any machine learning algorithms we use, for example in
computer vision.

### Modelling the environment

I'll get started building an environment and try to lead by example on this one. There
are tutorials for building simulations [here](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorial-1-your-first-simulation-in-webots?tab-language=python).

## Goals

- Reproducible mappings of the environment can be made which sufficiently communicates
  the risks to human life in an enclosed space.
- Our robot should work correctly in natural, urban and industrial environments.
- Navigation is efficient, detailed and doesn't put the robot in harm's way
- Our robot still works in previously unseen environments

## Approach

### Pathing

Using the A\* algorithm in combination with appropriate movement methods and hazard
identification & localisation will calculate optimal traversal of the space.

This will be done by constructing a node graph of space using mappings and assigning
relative weights based on actual calculated distance between nodes. Nodes near hazardous
objects or sources will have a higher weight. Nodes with the most empty space and no
local hazards will be the lowest weighted.

The algorithm will continually update the node graph and traverse safely in order to be
reactive to dynamic situations.
